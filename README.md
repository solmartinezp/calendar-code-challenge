# Digs Calendar Code Challenge
Author: Sol Martinez

## ABOUT:
The following project consists on a Calendar App addressed to the Diggs recruiting team in order to evaluate my application to join their Dev Team.

## Get started

1. Clone this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   or
   yarn
   ```
3. Start the app
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## CLARIFICATIONS:
The command that ended up working for me was "npm start", NOT "npm expo start"

Thank you for you time and consideration! Happy coding <3
